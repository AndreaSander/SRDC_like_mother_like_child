## Methods

### Participants
```{r participants information}
n <- final_data %>%
  distinct(unique_id) %>%
  tally()

age_min <- min(final_data$age, na.rm = T)
age_max<- max(final_data$age, na.rm = T)

```

 Participants for each study were recruited from a database of interested families in MontrÃ©al, Canada, largely via provincial birth lists, social media, and in-person recruitment, for example at libraries and community events. 
 
 The final sample consisted of data from `r n` aged `r age_min` to `r age_max` (M=`r age_mean`, SD=`r age_sd`). Of whom `r female` were female.
 

### Data Pre-Processing

  All the relevant LEQ data were manually entered from LEQ forms into excel spredsheets. The data were entered twice by two different researchers to minimize human errors. Demographic data were exported from Filemaker. LEQ and demographic data were merged together using a unique identifier per child per study, as some children participated in more than one study.
